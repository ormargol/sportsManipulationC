//modify app to read data from argv.
//strength is same but first argument is the chosen team and rest are manipulators for that team.
//run app with each team as chosen one, and all options to select which teams are manipulators for it.
//calculate required result using test_plan.txt file.
//if on the line of chosen team we sent all required manipulators, expect positive result.
//other ways expect negative result.
//modify app to be able to run with only result (the way the test will run it).
//allow app to run with full logs.
//when test found failure, it runs with full logs for debug purpose.
